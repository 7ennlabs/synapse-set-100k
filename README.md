## 🧠 SynapseSet-100K

**SynapseSet-100K** is a synthetic instruction-tuning dataset crafted to simulate EEG-based neurological state interpretation for natural language models. Each sample reflects brain signal metrics with contextual metadata, and an expert-style medical NLP explanation.

This dataset was generated by **7enn Labs** and aims to bridge neuroscience signal interpretation with instruction-tuned NLP systems.

> 🔬 100% synthetic, non-clinical data. Intended for academic and research purposes only.The right of use for the creation of this data has been created with algorithms belonging to our confidential party.

> 🔬 The potential of this data set is quite large, so we expect feedback from you. As 7enn Labs, we are thinking of developing models for data augmentation and accuracy of the dataset.

> 🔬 "This endeavor represents more than a mere product; it constitutes foundational infrastructure, a testament to our vision. At 7enn Labs, we regard this dataset as a significant milestone on a much broader strategic journey. Its importance lies not only in the algorithmic generation of the synthetic data itself but fundamentally in the power and continuous evolution of the proprietary data engine developed by 7enn Labs. Whether immediately recognized or widely adopted, systems of this nature are poised to shape the future. The tools we forge today are the very foundations upon which tomorrow's breakthroughs will be built."

## 🧬 Dataset Format

Each sample contains:
- `instruction`: Task description for the model
- `input`: EEG signal metrics with patient metadata
- `output`: Simulated clinical explanation

```json
{
  "instruction": "Interpret the given EEG values for a patient and explain their mental state.",
  "input": "Patient: ID#A7421 | Age: 38 | Date: 2024-10-12 | EEG: Alpha=9.8Hz, Beta=17.2Hz, Theta=4.1Hz, Delta=2.0Hz, Gamma=29.5Hz | Voltage=0.72mV",
  "output": "The EEG profile is consistent with relaxed wakefulness. Alpha wave dominance (9.8Hz) suggests the patient is in a calm, eyes-closed resting state. No signs of seizure activity or abnormal slowing are present."
}
```
